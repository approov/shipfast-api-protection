# SHIPFAST API PROTECTION

> **IMPORTANT:** This repository relates to Approov 1 and has not been updated to reflect the [new features](https://approov.io/docs/v2.0/changelog/) and [usage](https://approov.io/docs/v2.0/approov-usage-documentation/) of [Approov 2](https://approov.io/docs/v2.0/approov-installation/), the latest version of Approov. We will be updating the repository soon. Meanwhile, please refer to the [guide](https://approov.io/docs/v2.0/approov-usage-documentation/#migrating-from-approov-1) for migrating from Approov 1 to Approov 2.


This repository contains source code for the PRACTICAL API PROTECTION WALKTHROUGH blog series available at approov.io and medium.com.

In this mini series I will use a fictional product, “ShipFast”, to walk you through the process of defending against various exploits in a mobile application to gain access to data on a remote server allowing real users of the system to gain an unfair business advantage at the expense of the company.
