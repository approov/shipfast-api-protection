# SHIPFAST DEMO ON DOCKER

The blog post about Shipfast demo can be found [here](https://blog.approov.io/tag/a-series-shipfast).


# SETUP

## REQUIREMENTS

Your computer needs to have installed:

* Docker
* Docker Compose `>= 2.1`
* Git


## CLONE REPOSITORY

```bash
git clone git@github.com:approov/shipfast-api-protection.git && cd shipfast-api-protection
```

## Approov Cli Tool

To use the Shipfast demo we need to install the [Approov CLI tool](https://approov.io/docs/v2.0/approov-cli-tool-reference/) by following the [installation documentation](https://approov.io/docs/v2.0/approov-installation/).

> **ALERT:** Do not forget to set the Approov development token in your environment, as per instructions on the docs.


## ENVIRONMENT

Let's use the `.env.example` file as starting point for our `.env` file:

```bash
cp server/.env.example server/.env
```
and

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

### Required to Adjust

* `APPROOV_TOKEN_SECRET` - follow the [Appoov docs](https://approov.io/docs/v2.0/approov-usage-documentation/#token-secret-extraction) to get the Appoov secret.
* `AUTH0_DOMAIN` and `AUTH0_CLIENT_ID` - you can get one from your [Auth0 Dashboard](https://manage.auth0.com/dashboard).
* `ANDROID_GEO_API_KEY` - Get it from your Google console.
* `SHIPFAST_PUBLIC_DOMAIN` - The public url to the API backend for Shipfast. Needs be online, not a localhost one.
* `SHIPFAST_API_KEY` - Generate one wiht `strings /dev/urandom | head -n 256 | openssl dgst -sha256`


### Customize the Demo

When presenting the demo we may want to adapt it to the location of the customer, like center the map on its city, and use it's local currency and metric system.

#### Custom location

Get from Google maps the coordinates for your preferred location and set them in the following env vars:

```
DRIVER_LATITUDE=51.535472
DRIVER_LONGITUDE=-0.104971
```

> **NOTE**: After you start the Android emulator you will need to go to settings and them this same coordinates as the default ones for the device.


#### Custom Currency and Metric System

Adjust the following env vars according to your needs:

```
CURRENCY_SYMBOL="Â£"
DISTANCE_IN_MILES=true
```

All other defaults in the `.env` file are fine to run the demo.


## RUN THE DEMO

The demo is prepared to run in a Docker stack, including the Android Studio Editor, but feel free to not use Docker.

The bash script `./shipfast` is a wrapper around `docker-compose`, and for the developer convenience it includes some short-cuts commands that will perform all heavy lifting for us;

```
$ ./shipfast help

 Shipfast API:
    ./shipfast up api
    ./shipfast restart api
    ./shipfast down api

 Shipraider Web:
    ./shipfast up web
    ./shipfast restart web
    ./shipfast down web

 Android Studio:
    ./shipfast up editor
    ./shipfast restart editor
    ./shipfast down editor

```

### Backend

You need to run a backend for the Shipfast API and another to the ShipRaider Rogue Web interface.

The Shipfast API backend needs to run in an online server, so that you can fully evaluate the capabilities of Approov.

To start the Shipfast API backend:

```
$ ./shipfast up api
Creating dev.shipfast-api ... done
```

To start the Shipraider web interface:

```
$ ./shipfast up web
Creating dev.shipraider-web ... done
```

### Android Studio

To start Android Studio from docker:

```
./shipfast up editor
```
> **NOTE:** The first time its invoked it will build the docker image.

The first time the Android Studio is open, its a fresh installation of it from scratch, therefore you will be prompted several times to install the required dependencies.

Afterwards you need to open the Shipfast project, and:

* Build the project, and be prepared for some more downloads.
* Create a mobile device in the emulator.
* Start the app in the emulator for the mobile device:
    + Enable high accuracy location in the emulator mobile device settings.
    + Add manually the driver coordinates from the env vars to the emulator Location settings.
